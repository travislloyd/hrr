# hardlyrelevant.net

Website for Hardly Relevant Records.  This site is built using the Jekyll framework to be hosted on Github pages.  

## Website

`jekyll serve` is all you need to get the site up and running on localhost.  Jekyll integrates nicely with Github pages, so to deploy all you need to do is push changes to the master branch and the site will be live.  Currently it is hosted at http://hardlyrelevant.net.
